<h1>what we do</h1>
<p>I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? </p>
<p>Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. Not if I weaken first. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. I am your worst nightmare! I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. </p>
<p>Not if I weaken first. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others.</p>
